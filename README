This project contains replacements for things Apple has stupidly
removed from MacOS.

Things install under /usr/local.  The first time you build the
software, perform the following steps (as root):

  # make dirs
  # cd cmd/make && sh bootstrap

This will build and install bmake - the BSD make(1).  All the
Makefiles in this tree use bmake to build.

The 'mediascripts' directory contains some old Applescript utilities
I wrote for my EyeTV tuner.  That device has been out of support for
a few years now, and it's unlikely that the code works any longer ...
