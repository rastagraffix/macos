The more time goes by, the more Apple insists on removing perfectly
functional software from MacOS.  I guess anything the Hip Apple
Developers(tm) haven't personally witnessed does not exist.  (The
universe was formed in 2002, right? An offshoot from MacOS 9.)

Here are replacements for perfectly functional and useful tools that
Zombie Steve Jobs And His Minions have declared unworthy.

***   NB: this repo is in flux.  I have ignored it for years, but having
***   come back to MacOS not by choice, I need to resurrect many basic
***   UNIX commands the Hip Kids(tm) don't grok and therefore threw
***   overboard.


Projects
--------

ftp		Replace the perfectly viable ftp(1) command.

mediascripts	Command line tools to control the system volume and
		the DVD Player.  The latter doesn't work on recent
		MacOS releases because Zombie Steve Jobs has declared
		optical media are not sanctioned by him or his mindless
		followers.

nvi		BSD's nvi. (vim, without the clutter.)

rdist		A port of the 44BSD rdist(1) command.

telnet		Replace the perfectly viable telnet(1) command.
