nvi		BSD's nvi packaged up for a standalone build. I created
		this build tree so I would have an easy way to
		replace the "vim" versions of ex, vi, and view on my
		Mac OS machines with the traditional BSD ones. Note that
		'bsdmake install' leaves /usr/bin/vim and the vim(1)
		manpage alone.

		mindless minions have declared 'bsdmake' unworthy.
