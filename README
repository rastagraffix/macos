The more time goes by, the more Apple insists on removing perfectly
functional software from MacOS.  I guess anything the Hip Apple
Developers(tm) haven't personally witnessed does not exist.  (The
universe was formed in 2002, right? An offshoot from MacOS 9.)

Here are replacements for perfectly functional and useful tools that
Zombie Steve Jobs And His Minions have declared unworthy.

***   NB: this repo is in flux.  I have ignored it for years, but having
***   come back to MacOS not by choice, I need to resurrect many basic
***   UNIX commands the Hip Kids(tm) don't grok and therefore threw
***   overboard.


Projects
--------

bsdmake		Re-implement bsdmake(1), but without the bloated
		make templates.  See TODO below.

ftp		Replace the perfectly viable ftp(1) command.

mediascripts	Command line tools to control the system volume and
		the DVD Player.  The latter doesn't work on recent
		MacOS releases because Zombie Steve Jobs has declared
		optical media are not sanctioned by him or his mindless
		followers.

nvi		BSD's nvi packaged up for a standalone build. I created
		this build tree so I would have an easy way to
		replace the "vim" versions of ex, vi, and view on my
		Mac OS machines with the traditional BSD ones. Note that
		'bsdmake install' leaves /usr/bin/vim and the vim(1)
		manpage alone.

rdist		A port of the 44BSD rdist(1) command.

telnet		Replace the perfectly viable telnet(1) command.


TODO / Help
----

The eradication of bsdmake(1) throws a wrench into everything.  Since
most of this code is imported from BSD releases, a Berkeley make is
important.  A BSD make with a stripped down set of templates would
fit the bill here.  Work in progress ...
