nvi		BSD's nvi packaged up for a standalone build. I created
		this build tree so I would have an easy way to
		replace the "vim" versions of ex, vi, and view on my
		Mac OS machines with the traditional BSD ones. Note that
		'bsdmake install' leaves /usr/bin/vim and the vim(1)
		manpage alone.

route6d		The IPv6 RIPNG routing daemon. On my 10.6.8 systems with
		Parallels installed, the vnic? interfaces tend to claim
		the default route, despite on-going rtsol announcements
		from the default router. Announcing a default route
		from the border router via RIPNG combined with running
		'route6d -q' on the 10.6.8 hosts cures the problem.
