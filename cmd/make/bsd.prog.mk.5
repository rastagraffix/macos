.Sh NAME
.Nm bsd.prog.mk
.Nd Makefile fragment for building programs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd .include <bsd.prog.mk>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
contains the
.Xr bmake 1
framework for building programs.
The template defines several targets and variables that
help automate the build process.
.Sh TARGETS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm all
Default target.
Build the program and its manual pages.
.It Cm clean
Remove the program, object files, and any automatically
generated files.
.It Cm cleandir
Remove all the files removed by
.Cm clean ,
as well as the tags file.
.It Cm includes
Install any header files.
.It Cm install
Install the program and its manual pages.
If the default install recipe is used, the targets
.Cm beforeinstall
and
.Cm afterinstall
can be used to perform actions immediately before and
after the install target is run.
.It Cm tags
Generate a tags file from the source files.
.Sh VARIABLES
.Pp
Variables are used to customize build behaviour.
Many variables have default setting that can be
overridden if desired, such as
.Ev CC
and
.Ev YACC .
Other variables are intended to be augmented.
One example is
.Ev CFLAGS .
If you directly assign a value to
.Ev CFLAGS ,
you will overeide the build system defaults,
which might include compiler diagnoistic flags
implicitly added by
.Cm WARNINGS=Yes .
For those variables, you should augment the defaults by appending
to the existing settings:
.Cm CFLAGS+=-Dfoo=bar .
Some experimentation may be necessary to figure out which behaviour
works best in a particular setting.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev CC
The name of the C compiler.
.It Ev CDIAGFLAGS
Flags appended to
.Ev CFLAGS
if
.Ev WARNINGS
is set.
.It Ev CFLAGS
Flags passed to the compiler for building.
See also
.Ev COPTS ,
.Ev CDIAGFLAGS .
.It Ev COPTS
Supplementary options appended to 
.Ev CFLAGS
for building.
.It Ev CXXDIAGFLAGS
Flags appended to
.Ev CXXFLAGS
if
.Ev WARNINGS
is set.
.It Ev CXXFLAGS
Flags passed to the C++ compiler for building.
.It Ev CXXOPTS
User settings.
Supplementary options appended to ${CXXFLAGS} for building.
.It Ev PROG
.Bq Required
The name of the program to build.
A manpage file of the name
.Cm ${PROG}.1
is assumed to be present.
.It Ev SRCS
A list of the source files from which to build the program.
.Nm
implicitly recognizes a number of filename suffixes,
and invokes the corresponding compiler.
If
.Ev SRCS
is not defined,
.Cm ${PPROG}.c
is assumed.
.It Ev WARNINGS
User settings.
If set to
.Sq Yes ,
add
.Ev CDIAGFLAGS
to
.Ev CFLAGS
and
.Ev CXXDIAGFLAGS
to
.Ev CXXFLAGS .
.It Ev YACC
Name of the yacc compiler.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa ../Makefile.inc
Common Makefile fragment for a set of ports, included automatically.
