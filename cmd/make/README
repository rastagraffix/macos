This is Berkeley Make, imported from OpenBSD 7.1.

The changes are minimal:

	* renamed from make -> bmake to avoid conflict with
	  the MacOS make.
	* rebase everything from /usr -> /usr/local (binaries,
	  man pages, make templates).
	* remove OpenBSD-specific bits that don't applyy here
	  (bsd.port*.mk, bsd.x*.mk, much internal *.mk goop).

A GNUmakefile has been added that simplifies the bootstrap
process:

	1) Run 'make'. This will perform a minimal build.
	2) Run 'make install'. This will install just enough
	   pieces to allow for a full build using the just-
	   bootstrapped binary.
	3) Run 'make clean' followed by './bmake'.  This will
	   rebuild everything (including documentation) using
	   the full bmake infrastructure.
	4) Run './bmake install' to install everything.

If you have a non-Gnu POSIX make, use 'make -f GNUmakefile'
in the comands above.

The current (Oct 2022) state of the make templates is quite
fragile. Enough bits are working to build bmake itself, and
most simple things that rely only on <bsd.prog.mk> should
work. I haven't tackled <bsd.lib.mk> yet.

Note: I will not be adding esoteric support for every last
thing Xcode supports. My goal is to provide an environment
that allows you to build general purpose native BSD software
on MacOS.
