.Sh NAME
.Nm bsd.lib.mk
.Nd Makefile fragment for building libraries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd .include <bsd.lib.mk>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
contains the
.Xr bmake 1
framework for building libraries.
It builds both static
.Pq Ns Pa lib${LIB}.a
and
profiled static
.Pq Ns Pa lib${LIB}_p.a
versions
of each.
.Pp
If the file
.Pa shlib_version
exists in the source directory, a shared library will
also be built.
The
.Pa shlib_version
file must define two Makefile variables:
.Pp
.Bd -indent
.Bl -tag -compact
.It Ev major
The shared library major version number.
.It Ev minor
The shared library minor version number.
.El
.Ed
.Pp
The resulting shared library will be named
.Pa lib${LIB}.so.${major}.${minor} .
.Pp
The template defines several targets and variables that
help automate the build process.
.Sh TARGETS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic all
Default target.
Build the library.
.It Ic clean
Remove the library, object files, and any automatically
generated files.
.It Ic cleandir
Remove all the files removed by
.Ic clean ,
as well as the tags file.
.It Ic includes
Install any header files.
.It Ic install
Install the library and its manual pages.
If the default install recipe is used, the targets
.Ic beforeinstall
and
.Ic afterinstall
can be used to perform actions immediately before and
after the
.Ic install
target is run.
.It Ic tags
Generate a tags file from the source files.
.El
.Sh VARIABLES
.Pp
Variables are used to customize build behavior.
Many variables have default setting that can be
overridden if desired, such as
.Ev CC
and
.Ev YACC .
Other variables are intended to be augmented.
One example is
.Ev CFLAGS .
If you directly assign a value to
.Ev CFLAGS ,
you will override the build system defaults,
which might include compiler diagnostic flags
implicitly added by
.Ic WARNINGS=Yes .
For those variables, you should augment the defaults by appending
to the existing settings:
.Ic CFLAGS+=-Dfoo=bar .
Some experimentation might be necessary to figure out which behavior
works best in a particular setting.
.\"
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.\"
.It Ev CC
The name of the C compiler.
.\"
.It Ev CDIAGFLAGS
Flags appended to
.Ev CFLAGS
when
.Ev WARNINGS
is set.
.\"
.It Ev CFLAGS
Flags passed to the compiler for building.
See also
.Ev COPTS ,
.Ev CDIAGFLAGS .
.\"
.It Ev CLEANFILES
Additional files to be removed by the
.Ic clean
target.
.\"
.It Ev COPTS
Supplementary options appended to 
.Ev CFLAGS
for building.
This variable is generally reserved for the user.
.\"
.It Ev CXXDIAGFLAGS
Flags appended to
.Ev CXXFLAGS
if
.Ev WARNINGS
is set.
.\"
.It Ev CXXFLAGS
Flags passed to the C++ compiler for building.
.\"
.It Ev CXXOPTS
Supplementary options appended to
.Ev CXXFLAGS
for building.
This variable is generally reserved for the user.
.\"
.It Ev DEBUG
Flags added to assembly, C[++] compiler, and linker passes.
.\"
.It Ev DESTDIR
If defined, this path is prepended to pathnames of every file
installed by the
.Ic install
target.
It is mainly used to install files into a shadow directory where
they are used to create an installation package.
Typical usage is to specify the value on the command line
of the installation run.
For example, to install into the
.Pa /tmp/foo
directory (which must already exist):
.Pp
.Dl make -DDESTDIR=/tmp/foo install
.Pp
This convention relies on the
.Nm bmake
recipes prefixing all installation paths with
.Ic ${DESTDIR}
as follows:
.Pp
.Dl install ${LIB}.a ${DESTDIR}${LIBDIR}/lib${LIB}.a
.\"
.It Ev DPADD
Additional dependencies for the library.
Typically used to specify archive file dependencies.
.\"
.It Ev LD
The name of the linker.
.\"
.It Ev LDADD
Additional linker objects.
.\"
.It Ev LDFLAGS
Additional linker flags.
.\"
.It Ev LEX
The name of the lexer.
.\"
.It Ev LIB
.Bq Required
The name of the library to build.
.\"
.It Ev LIBDIR
The directory where libraries are installed.
.\"
.It Ev LFLAGS
Flags passed to the lexer.
.\"
.It Ev LINKS
A list of file links to create during install.
Each item should be a full pathname.
The list contains source-file target-file pairs.
For example, to link
.Pa /bin/test
and
.Pa /bin/[
use
.Pp
.Dl LINKS= ${DESTDIR}/bin/test ${DESTDIR}/bin/[
.It Ev MAN
The list of manual pages to install.
.\"
.It Ev SRCS
.Bq Required
A list of the source files from which to build the library.
.Nm bsd.lib.mk
implicitly recognizes a number of filename suffixes,
and invokes the corresponding compiler.
.\"
.It Ev WARNINGS
If set to
.Sq Yes ,
add
.Ev CDIAGFLAGS
to
.Ev CFLAGS
and
.Ev CXXDIAGFLAGS
to
.Ev CXXFLAGS .
.\"
.It Ev YACC
The name of the yacc compiler.
.\"
.It Ev YFLAGS
Flags passed to the yacc compiler for building.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa ../Makefile.inc
Common Makefile fragment for a set of libraries, included automatically.
.It pa shlib_version
If present, triggers the build of a shared library.
The file must define the variables
.Va major
and
.Va minor .
