BSDftpd-ssl is a secure FTP server that supports industry standard TLS/SSL
encryption and authentication for whole FTP sessions and data transfers.

The TLS/SSL encryption provides both the integrity and confidentiality
protections for the passwords and the transferring data.

This implementation is compatible with the original FTP protocol, which is
described in RFC 959, and the TLS/SSL enhancement allows RFC 2228 "FTP Security
Extensions"-compliant TLS/SSL protection for both control and data channels.

This package contains the secure FTP server, which is named "ftpd", a command-
line secure FTP client utility, which is named "ftps", an essential
documentation, and also script programs for a basic X.509 certificate
management.

Supported operating systems are:
- FreeBSD 4.11, 5.3.
- NetBSD 1.6.2, 2.0.
- Fedora Core 2, 3.
- Debian GNU/Linux 3.0r2.

The software also works with some old versions of next operating systems:
- FreeBSD 4.7-4.10 and 5.0-5.2.
- RedHat Linux 9, 8.0 and 7.3.
- Fedora Core 1.
- ALT Linux Master 2.2.

Installation and configuration issues are described in the INSTALL file.

The FTP server and the FTP client are based, respectively, on the FTP daemon
and the FTP command-line client utility from FreeBSD operating system
(http://www.freebsd.org).

Initial TLS/SSL modifications are based on the code developed by
Tim Hudson <tjh@cryptsoft.com> for use in the SSLftp project, which can be
obtained from ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/SSLapps.

These modifications for TLS/SSL support, RFC 2228 features and Linux port were
made by Nick Leuta <skynick@mail.sc.ru>
